/**
 * ESPN's team and roster endpoints, for every league that is not college
 * football.
 *
 * 🚨 Two calls' worth of shapes, both read off live responses in September 2026
 * rather than from documentation, because ESPN publishes none for this:
 *
 *     /{sport}/{league}/teams              → sports[0].leagues[0].teams[].team
 *     /{sport}/{league}/teams/{id}/roster  → athletes[]
 *
 * 🚨 And `athletes[]` comes in TWO shapes depending on the sport. The NFL, MLB
 * and the NHL answer GROUPS — `[{position: "offense", items: [...]}]` — and the
 * NBA answers a FLAT list of athletes. Reading only one loses every player in
 * half the leagues, and the failure is silent: an empty roster page.
 *
 * 🚨 No API key, which is why this is the multi-sport source.
 * CollegeFootballData stays where it is used because it carries the recruiting
 * class, the transfer portal and season-by-season statistics that ESPN's roster
 * endpoint does not answer at all — not because ESPN could not list a roster.
